      <h1>Introduction</h1>
   
         <p>In today's digital era, cyber security has become an essential aspect of daily life. With the increasing use of the internet, smartphones, and digital services, individuals are more exposed to online threats such as phishing, identity theft, financial fraud, and social media scams. These challenges are especially critical for vulnerable groups in both rural and urban areas who may lack awareness of online safety measures.</p>

         <p>This project titled <strong>“Cyber Security Awareness: Conducting Workshops and Creating Resources to Educate Vulnerable Groups in Rural/Urban Areas”</strong> aims to spread knowledge about safe online practices and enhance digital literacy. Through workshops and interactive sessions, participants are guided on how to identify cyber threats, protect personal data, use strong passwords, and recognize fraudulent activities online.</p>

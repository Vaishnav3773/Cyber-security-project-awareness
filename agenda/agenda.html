                <h3>Common Cybersecurity Threats</h3>
                <p>Students face numerous digital threats that can compromise personal information, finances, and academic work.</p>
                
                <h4>Financial Threats</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bank scams</strong> — fake bank messages, fraudulent payment requests, or apps that steal banking credentials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fake scholarship offers</strong> — requests for payment or personal information in exchange for non-existent scholarships.</li>
                    <li><strong>Student loan scams</strong> — offers to reduce or eliminate student loans for a fee.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Identity & Data Threats</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Phishing</strong> — deceptive emails, SMS, or social media messages that trick you into revealing information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social engineering</strong> — manipulation techniques that exploit human psychology to gain access to information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identity theft</strong> — when someone uses your personal information without permission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data breaches</strong> — unauthorized access to personal data stored by organizations.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Academic Threats</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fake job offers</strong> — targeting students with promises of high-paying, flexible work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plagiarism services</strong> — websites that offer to write papers but may blackmail students later.</li>
                    <li><strong>Course material scams</strong> — selling fake or stolen academic materials.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="stat-box">
                    <strong>Did you know?</strong> According to recent studies, students are 3x more likely to fall for phishing scams than other demographic groups.

                <h3>How Students Get Trapped</h3>
                <p>Understanding common pitfalls can help you avoid becoming a victim of cybercrime.</p>
                
                <h4>Psychological Traps</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Urgency</strong> — responding to messages that create artificial time pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Authority</strong> — trusting messages that appear to come from official sources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social proof</strong> — believing offers that claim many other students have benefited.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scarcity</strong> — falling for "limited time" offers that create fear of missing out.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Technical Mistakes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sharing OTPs, PINs, or passwords because the message looked urgent.</li>
                    <li>Installing apps from unofficial stores that request excessive permissions.</li>

                    <li>Not updating software and apps regularly, leaving security vulnerabilities.</li>
                </ul>
